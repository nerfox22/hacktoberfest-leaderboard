Happy coding!

## Configuring the app
Configuration is exclusively done by setting environment variables:
* `PORT` : The port to bind HTTP to. Default to `8080`
* `GH_TOKEN` : The token to authenticated to github. By default, no token is used, so API calls are not authenticated.
* `EVENT_DATE` : The date to restrict contribution search to. It must follows the github search date format (more details [here](https://help.github.com/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax/#query-for-dates)). Default value is `>=2005` which basically fetch everything without any restriction
* `PARTICIPANTS_FILE` : The URI or file path to the file containing the participants' github usernames. See [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ourtigarage/hacktoberfest-leaderboard/master/tests/resources/participants.md) for an example of how to format that file
* `OBJECTIVE` : Number of pull requests to make in order to complete the challenge. Default value is `4`

> If the app is running behind a proxy, you'll need to set both environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` before running it
